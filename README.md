# Shopify App QR Code - Remix

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using the [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.

Rather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).

Visit the [`shopify.dev` documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix) for more details on the Remix app package.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
2. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you donâ€™t have one.
3. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### Setup

If you used the CLI to create the template, you can skip this section.

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.

### Build

Remix handles building the app for you, by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run build
```

### Debuging PosgresSQL database

```
gcloud sql connect amazing-app --user=postgres --quiet
```

## Hosting

When you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

Deploy to Cloud Run

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t amazing-app .

docker tag amazing-app REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/ARTIFACT_FOLDER/amazing-app:1.3

docker push REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/ARTIFACT_FOLDER/amazing-app:1.3

gcloud run deploy --image REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/ARTIFACT_FOLDER/amazing-app:1.3
```

## Gotchas / Troubleshooting

### Database tables don't exist

If you get this error:

```
The table `main.Session` does not exist in the current database.
```

You need to create the database for Prisma. Run the `setup` script in `package.json` using your preferred package manager.

### Navigating/redirecting breaks an embedded app

Embedded Shopify apps must maintain the user session, which can be tricky inside an iFrame. To avoid issues:

1. Use `Link` from `@remix-run/react` or `@shopify/polaris`. Do not use `<a>`.
2. Use the `redirect` helper returned from `authenticate.admin`. Do not use `redirect` from `@remix-run/node`
3. Use `useSubmit` or `<Form/>` from `@remix-run/react`. Do not use a lowercase `<form/>`.

This only applies if you app is embedded, which it will be by default.

### Non Embedded

Shopify apps are best when they are embedded into the Shopify Admin. This template is configured that way. If you have a reason to not embed your please make 2 changes:

1. Change the `isEmbeddedApp` prop to false for the `AppProvider` in `/app/routes/app.jsx`
2. Remove any use of App Bridge APIs (`window.shopify`) from your code
3. Update the config for shopifyApp in `app/shopify.server.js`. Pass `isEmbeddedApp: false`

### OAuth goes into a loop when I change my app's scopes

If you change your app's scopes and authentication goes into a loop and fails with a message from Shopify that it tried too many times, you might have forgotten to update your scopes with Shopify.
To do that, you can run the `deploy` CLI command.

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run deploy
```

### My webhook subscriptions aren't being updated

This template registers webhooks after OAuth completes, using the `afterAuth` hook when calling `shopifyApp`.
The package calls that hook in 2 scenarios:

- After installing the app
- When an access token expires

During normal development, the app won't need to re-authenticate most of the time, so the subscriptions aren't updated.

To force your app to update the subscriptions, you can uninstall and reinstall it in your development store.
That will force the OAuth process and call the `afterAuth` hook.

### Admin created webhook failing HMAC validation

Webhooks subscriptions created in the [Shopify admin](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/notifications/webhooks) will fail HMAC validation. This is because the webhook payload is not signed with your app's secret key.

Create [webhook subscriptions](<(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix/v1/guide-webhooks)>) using the `shopifyApp` object instead.

Test your webhooks with the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#webhook-trigger) or by triggering events manually in the Shopify admin(e.g. Updating the product title to trigger a `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`).

### Incorrect GraphQL Hints

By default the [graphql.vscode-graphql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) extension for VS Code will assume that GraphQL queries or mutations are for the [Shopify Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin). This is a sensible default, but it may not be true if:

1. You use another Shopify API such as the storefront API.
2. You use a third party GraphQL API.

in this situation, please update the [.graphqlrc.ts](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/.graphqlrc.ts) config.

## Tech Stack

This template uses [Remix](https://remix.run). The following Shopify tools are also included to ease app development:

- [Shopify App Remix](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix) provides authentication and methods for interacting with Shopify APIs.
- [Shopify App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge) allows your app to seamlessly integrate your app within Shopify's Admin.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Webhooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-webhook-requests): Callbacks sent by Shopify when certain events occur
- [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/): Design system that enables apps to create Shopify-like experiences
